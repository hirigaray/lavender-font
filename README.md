# Lavender

This is a console font that is heavily inspired by Sun Gallant Demi and the XNU console font.

Currently, only ASCII characters and a few others adhere to the wanted style, I'm still working on it.

All other glyphs come from GNU Unifont, in order to have a relatively complete set of glyphs.
